As a first step towards understanding memorability of objects in
images, we compile an image database containing a variety of objects
from a diverse range of categories, as well as, measure the
probability that every object in each database image will be
remembered by a large group of subjects after a single viewing. 
%
This
helps provide ground truth memorability scores for objects inside
images (defined as image segments) and allows for a precise analysis
of the memorable elements within an image. 
%
Toward this, we utilized the
PASCAL-S dataset \cite{yin14}, a fully segmented dataset built on the
validation set of the PASCAL VOC 2010 \cite{pascal10} segmentation
challenge. To improve segmentation quality, we manually refined the
segmentations from this dataset. We removed all homogenous non-object
or background segments (e.g. ground, grass, floor, and sky), along
with, imperceptible object fragments and excessively blurred
regions. All remaining object segmentations were tested for
memorability. In summary, our final dataset comprises $850$ images and
$3,412$ object segmentations (i.e. an average of $4$ objects per
image), for which we gathered ground truth memorability through crowd
sourcing. %\B{how about image size? - they were all in their original
          %sizes and aspect ratios.}
