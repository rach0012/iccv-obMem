As a first step towards understanding memorability of objects, we built an image database containing a variety of objects from a diverse range of categories, and measured the probability that every object in each image will be remembered by a large group of subjects after a single viewing. This helps provide ground truth memorability scores for the objects inside the images and allows for a precise analysis of the memorable elements within an image. For this task, we utilized the PASCAL-S dataset \cite{yin14}, a fully segmented dataset built on the validation set of the PASCAL VOC 2010 \cite{pascal10} segmentation challenge. For improved segmentation purposes, we manually cleaned up and refined the segmentations from this dataset. While building the improved ground-truth of full segmentation, we removed all homogenous non-object or background segments such as ground, grass, floor, sky etc, as well as imperceptible object fragments and excessively blurred regions. All remaining object segmentations were tested for memorability. In the end, our final dataset consisted of $850$ images and $3414$ object segmentations i.e. on average each image consisted of approximately $4$ segments for which we gathered the ground truth memorability on.
