In this paper, we pose the problem of understanding the memorability of objects in images. To this end, we obtained ground truth data that helps to understand this problem in depth. We show that the category of the object has meaningful influence on its memorability, and that visual saliency can predict object memorability to some degree. In addition, we studied the relationship between image and object memorability, and used our experimental data to build a benchmark dataset for object memorability prediction. Our work opens doors for a wide variety of application in computer vision and computational photography. Future work will involve understanding the influence of non-object image regions and other potential contextual influences that may or may not involve other objects on memorability.
