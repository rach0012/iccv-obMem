In this paper, we propose the problem of understanding the memorability of objects in images. To this end, we obtained ground truth data that helps to study and analyze this problem in depth. We show that the category of an object has meaningful influence on its memorability, and that visual saliency can predict object memorability to some degree. Moreover, we studied the relationship between image and object memorability and compiled a benchmark dataset for automated object memorability prediction. Our work opens doors for a variety of applications in computer vision and computational photography. Future work will involve studying the influence of non-object image regions and scene context on memorability.
