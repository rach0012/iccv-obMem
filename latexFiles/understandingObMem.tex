%In this section, we aim to better understand object memorability by focusing on visually manifesting factors that influence whether an object in an image is more memorable or forgettable to humans. \B{give an overview of these factors, e.g. color, saliency, size, etc.}%We first investigate the role that simple color features play in determining object memorability.


In this section, we aim to better understand how object memorability is influenced by visual factors that manifest themselves in natural images. Specifically, we study the relationship between \B{give list of factors here} and how memorable or forgettable an object in an image is to humans. The results of this study can be used to guide the development and innovation of automated algorithms that can predict object memorability.
