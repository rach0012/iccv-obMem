In this section, we aim to better understand object memorability and the factors that make an object more memorable or forgettable to humans. We first investigate the role that simple color features play in determining object memorability.

\subsection{Can simple features explain memorability?}

\input{simple}

\subsection{What is the role of saliency in memorability?}

\input{fixation}

\subsection{How do object categories affect memorability?}

\input{objectLabel}

\subsection{How are object \& image memorability related?}

\input{imageMem}
